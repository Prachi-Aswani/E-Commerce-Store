# E-Commerce Store Database Design & SQL Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and analysis of an e-commerce store database using SQL.  
The goal is to build a relational database, insert realistic sample data, and perform business-driven analysis to extract meaningful insights.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends for an e-commerce store using structured SQL queries.

## 🗂️ Database Schema
The database consists of the following tables:

- customers — customer details and signup information  
- products — product catalog with categories and stock  
- orders — order records and order status  
- order_items — mapping of products within each order  
- payments — payment details for completed orders  

Foreign key relationships ensure data integrity across tables.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- MySQL  
- GitHub  

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Total revenue calculation  
- Revenue by product category  
- Best-selling products  
- Top customers by total spend  
- Cancelled orders count  
- Revenue trend by order status  

## 💡 Business Insights
- Identified highest revenue-generating products  
- Determined top spending customers  
- Observed proportion of cancelled versus delivered orders  
- Analyzed payment mode distribution  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench (or any SQL environment)  
2. Copy contents of ecommerce_analysis.sql  
3. Execute the script to create tables and insert data  
4. Run analysis queries to view results  

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add CTEs and Window Functions for advanced analytics  
- Implement indexes for query optimization  
- Connect database to Power BI for visualization
